RootBud- A productivity plant that the main purpose is to increase productivity by setting a timer motivating users to become more productive as they are caring for a pet plant. 
Technologies used 
VS Code
Flutter
Android SDK
Git
GitHub
GitHub Codespaces

Setup and Installation Instructions:

To start, the entire project is done thru VS Code, so ensure that VS Code is installed and that it’s installed with the Flutter, Git, and GitHub adjacent Extensions.

Next, ensure that Android Studio is downloaded and it installs Android SDK version 15 and Command Line Tools. Then set up the emulator. The emulator we focused our use on for this project is the Pixel 3.

Then using GitHub, make a Clone Repository of the GitHub Repo, this is because a Codespace/Remote repository will not allow you to properly use the emulator device.

Lastly, to begin running the project, open up the terminal in the project and type cd flutter_app, then type flutter run to begin running the app.


If any errors occur with flutter, you need to type flutter doctor and follow along with the fixes the terminal addresses.



Team members and their contributions 
Chris Sanchez- Learned how to use TypeScript code, came up with the primary product we were going to create, taught us how to use different branches and GitHub features, learned some react, and helped with the code in TypeScript, then also learned Flutter and helped troubleshoot every step of the way when it came to technical issues on our devices

Michael Lopez- Creation of the pet plant pixel drawing, the original brainstormer for the idea of RootBud as our project’s name, the setup for our initial react cpde, then set up the Flutter code, learned Flutter, created a bulk of the foundation of the current code, helped navigating the GitHub repo, and helped troubleshoot every step of the way when it came to technical issues on our devices. 

Tyler Chadwick- UI/UX Design using Figma, creation of the Google documents, and detected the necessary vs.additional features. Additionally, he came up with good features that should be implemented, wrote most of the README document and it’s required assets, and created the UML which became a really good resource in helping in the design of the code. Throughout the way he also offered good feedback pieces to many of the parts of this project which helped better the end product.
 
Emdya Permuy-Llovio - UI/UX Design using Figma, editing for the 5 min pitch, and the creation of the Impact Assessment Document. Creator of the Demo portion of this project and helped a lot during people’s points of confusion and acted as a great leader during those moments of chaos, and they were the one who submitted most of the necessary documentation and recordings to the Devpost website. She was also the one to originally get the team together when the Hackathon first began.
