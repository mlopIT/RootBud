# flutter_app

A new Flutter project.

Before you begin, ensure that you have atleast one android connected and powered on (running):

Go to far bottom left corner of screen in VS Code.
Click "No Device" or "Windows (windows-x64)" to open a list of available android devices.
In the top search bar across the top portion of the screen, select "Pixel 3" or whichever Android system you'd prefer to run the Flutter app on.


TO BEGIN GO TO THE TERMINAL AND RUN THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS:

cd flutter_app

flutter run

Now you wait, for the flutter app to load...

Please note...
When changing the "main.dart" file of the app, 
press lowercase r inside of the VS Code terminal to "hot-reload" the Flutter app (its an easy way to see all of the changes you've made to the app).
